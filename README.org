* esy-mode

  =esy-mode= is a minor mode written for [[http://esy.sh][esy]] - the package manager for
  Reason/OCaml development. It is meant to serve as a auxiliary plugin
  that helps other plugins to find the correct path to the tools.

  For instance, it can help lsp-mode get the right path to ocaml
  language server.

** Pre-requisites

   This minor mode is meant to work with =esy= which is not shipped
   here. Quickest way to get =esy= installed on your machine is to
   install it globally using a nodejs package manager
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     npm i -g esy
     # or
     yarn global add esy
   #+END_SRC

   No, =esy= is not written in JS, but a prebuilt binary and is
   currently only containing ones that work on 64 bit Windows, Linux
   and MacOS. More details on the [[http://esy.sh][website]]

** Installation

   At the moment the package hasn't been published anywhere. Quickest
   way to  get started is to clone the repo and load it

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     git clone https://github.com/prometheansacrifice/esy-mode
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (load-file "/path/to/esy-mode/esy-mode.el")
   #+END_SRC  

   If you use quelpa and use package, you can use the following

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package
       esy-mode
       :quelpa (esy-mode :path "/path/to/esy-mode.el" :fetcher file)
       :hook reason-mode
       :config (progn
		 (lsp-register-client
		  (make-lsp-client
		   :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection '("ocamllsp"))
		   :major-modes '(reason-mode tuareg-mode)
		   :server-id 'esy-ocamlmerlin-lsp))))
   #+END_SRC

** How it works 

   All =npm= and =opam= managed Reason/OCaml projects are valid esy projects too.
   This means, the minor mode must correctly distinguish them from actual =esy= projects
   (which are basically Reason/OCaml source with build config files
   shipped with an =esy.json= or a =package.json=).

   =esy= provides a =status= sub-command. Which can return an output
   like this in the case of an esy project

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     {
       "isProject": true,
       "isProjectSolved": true,
       "isProjectFetched": true,
       "isProjectReadyForDev": true,
       "rootBuildPath": "/path/to/g/foo/_esy/default/store/b/foo-03e8a06e",
       "rootInstallPath": "/path/to/g/foo/_esy/default/store/i/foo-03e8a06e",
       "rootPackageConfigPath": "/path/to/g/foo/esy.json"
     }
   #+END_SRC

   For an opam project, it could look like

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     {
       "isProject": true,
       "isProjectSolved": true,
       "isProjectFetched": true,
       "isProjectReadyForDev": true,
       "rootBuildPath": "/path/to/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/_esy/default/store/b/ocaml_lsp-38a74123",
       "rootInstallPath": "/path/to/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/_esy/default/store/i/ocaml_lsp-38a74123",
       "rootPackageConfigPath": null
     }
   #+END_SRC

   So,

   1. All non-json manifest file driven projects, by looking up
      =rootPackageConfigPath= property, are opam projects
   2. Among json file driven projects,
      
      1. Those with that are not package.json are esy projects
      2. =package.json= with =esy= property are =esy= projects -
         others were being managed by npm
   
   Valid =esy= projects are straight forward to handle - the minor
   checks if the project is in buildable state and prompts if it
   isn't.

   =esy= provides the [[https://esy.sh/docs/en/environment.html][command environment]] (the environment where tools
   like editors are supposed to run) as a json output. =esy-mode= load
   all the complete environment in a buffer local
   =process-environment= giving each project workspace the identical
   development environment. Here on, running =(executable-find ...)=
   returns the dev tools from the =esy= sandbox, ensuring you and your
   co-worker always have the same exact version of tools while
   developing.

   
**** Why load the environment when one can simply `esy exec-command`?

     =esy exec-command <tool-command> = is a great approach. For better
     editor experience, one might have to resort to =esy exec-command
     command -v <tool-command> = repeatedly to check if the tool
     exists and inform the user. =(executable-find ...)= is better
     approach IMO. This is subject to how Emacs handles buffer local
     process environments of course.

   
*** NPM and Bucklescript build system managed projects

    =npm= unfortunately doesn't handle prebuilts with reproducibility
    guarantees, nor does it sandbox tools that need each other on the
    path to work together. Mismatching compiler and [[https://github.com/ocaml/merlin][merlin]] prebuilts
    cause a lot of confusion - using npm to install these tools
    globally is not an easy experience for newcomers.

    On the other hand, inter-tool interaction is not reliable in
    global environments. For instance, =ocamlmerlin= expects
    =ocamlmerlin-reason= binary to be available in it's path - and
    both of these must be built with the *same* version of the
    compiler. In the global environment, it was incredibly hard to get
    them to work - user's system wide configuration is a complete
    blackbox. The only reliable way to ensure interacting tools work
    together is to run them in sandboxed environments - and esy
    provides just that!

    This is why we recommend bucklescript users to allow editor
    plugins to drop an =esy.json= - plugins look into the compiler
    version and create this file themselves.

*** Opam managed projects

    This is a work in progress - =esy= provides sandboxed environments
    for opam projects too (without creating any =esy.json=). But opam
    users dont ship development time dependencies in their package
    manifests. It's best for the plugin to fallback to opam installed
    tools for now (TODO)

** Contributing guidelines

   Currently beta quality. Looking forward to ideas and feedback. If
   you're raising a PR, please add a test. Not having types to catch
   your errors are hard - even if lisp somehow makes it bearable,
   let's ensure we still try to catch errors early!
